1.Kafka robustness
Consumers are simple; no idempotency keys, no dead-letter strategy, no offset commit retries beyond happy path. That’s fine for PoC, risky in prod.
2.Auth inconsistency (JWT vs HMAC)

Most services use standard JWT (golang-jwt), but notification-service uses a custom HMAC token (raw.sig with verifyToken).

Impact: Any real JWT from your gateway will be rejected by notification-service; protected endpoints will 401.

Fix: Switch notification-service internal/shared/httpx to the same JWT parser you use elsewhere (HS256; sub claim). Keep env JWT_SECRET consistent.

3. Message privacy & integrity

message-service doesn’t verify membership for:

sending messages (Send, SendWithUpload)

reading chat history (ListByChat)

marking seen (MarkSeen)

Impact: Any authenticated user can read or post in any chat by guessing chat_id.

Fix (service layer):

Add IsMember(chatID, userID) (bool, error) to chat.Repository/Service (or reuse a SELECT 1 FROM chat_users …).

In message.Service:

Send/SendWithUpload: require membership.

ListByChat: require membership.

MarkSeen: require membership (and optionally that the message belongs to that chat).

Optional: store sender’s membership at send-time; double check on read.

4. Post upload flow lacks bearer -> media-service

post-service UploadAndCreate → uploadToMediaService calls media-service without Authorization.

Impact: Works only when media-service JWT_SECRET is empty (dev). Fails in prod (401).

Fix:

In post/handler.UploadAndCreate, extract bearer (add httpx.BearerToken helper like in other services) and pass it into svc.UploadAndCreate.

Thread the bearer to uploadToMediaService and set Authorization: Bearer <token>.

5. Notification read API is public by path

GET /users/{user_id}/notifications is public (no auth), falling back to auth only if path param missing.

Impact: Anyone can fetch someone else’s notifications by user_id.

Fix: Require auth and ensure {user_id} equals sub from JWT (or drop the path variant and only serve /notifications).

6. feed service c2 lvl design with v1 and v2 what it correct?

7. feedback-service Redis addr has no defaults Addr: os.Getenv("REDIS_HOST")+":"+os.Getenv("REDIS_PORT") ⇒ could become ":" if unset. Fix: Provide sane defaults (e.g., redis-feedback:6379) like other services.

8. Kafka acks

message-service writer: RequiredAcks: RequireNone, Async: true → higher throughput, lower durability.

Fix (if you care about durability): Use RequireOne (or RequireAll) and/or sync mode for user messages. Keep feed/post event producer decisions explicit.

9. media-service S3 PresignPut You build reqParams with content-type but don’t pass it (MinIO’s PresignedPutObject doesn’t take that arg anyway). Not harmful; just remove dead code or add a comment.

10. message-service messages.is_seen column

track read receipts in message_seen, but never flip is_seen. Two choices:

Remove is_seen (avoid dual sources of truth)

11. feed-service scoring ignores engagement Score = created_at only.  already have Likes/Views in PostEvent—unused. Fix (later): Blend likes/views and decay (e.g., score = ts + α*likes + β*views - decay(t)), or compute in repo when storing.

12. Standardize httpx.BearerToken helper

13. Consistent error shapes

Some middlewares produce {error, reason}, some just {error}. Consider a small shared package or guideline for uniform API errors (helps clients & observability).
